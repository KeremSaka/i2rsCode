rip_debug.* deleted

rip_snmp.c deleted 

rip_offset.c deleted

rip_interface.* deleted (maybe change back to get this file, file has cmds for interface operation)

rip_peer.c deleted

rip_routemap.c cannot be deleted -> makes problems in vty files and blocks
than compilation problems

delete anything else makes error in compilation
ripd.c has funktion for adding routes

after debug understand that 
rip compiles wrong have to ask edwin for this

new idea why add doesnÂ´t work need maybe the callback funktion in zclient to work properly
